# Pixel Perfect React JS Assignment

## 🎯 Objective

Create a pixel-perfect React JS application based on the provided Adobe XD design. The goal is to match layout, typography, colors, and spacing exactly. The design was implemented **without responsiveness** and focused solely on desktop view fidelity.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- React.js (via CDN)

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **Pixel-perfect layout** matching the Adobe XD design
- Used a combination of `top` + `padding` to achieve perfect heading alignment  
  ⚠️ *Example: For a required top spacing of 140px, layout accuracy was maintained using `padding + top` — this approach ensures the heading renders exactly as designed*
- All elements placed with precision in desktop view
- Modular, clean codebase with no additional frameworks
